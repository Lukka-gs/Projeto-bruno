# Auth Service

This is a simple authentication microservice with a mocked user.

## Backend
Run the backend:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```
The server runs on port `3002` by default.

## Frontend
A minimal frontend is served by the backend automatically. After starting the backend, open [`http://localhost:3002`](http://localhost:3002) in your browser to access the login page.

Credentials:
- **username:** `admin`
- **password:** `senha123`
